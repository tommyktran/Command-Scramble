##About

With the 4 big buttons at the bottom of the game screen, use the attack command (with the letters ABC) and the reload command (with the letter CA) and target the enemies (by clicking or using the keyboard keys Q/W/E) to kill them. 

This game can be played with or without the keyboard. Controls are as follows:

* A/S/Z/X or click the buttons : command inputs, A/B/C/D respectively
* Enter or click the gray arrow button : enter the command
* Backspace or click the gray circle button: clear the command
