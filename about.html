            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This little game thing is a project for Code Louisville. Your objective is to kill the enemy ships that pop up on the screen and survive for as long as you can. If your shield goes down to 0%, you lose!</p>
            <p>There are two commands: attack and reload. To attack, target an enemy first (with QWE or by clicking the enemy) and input "ABC" with the buttons. To reload, input "CA".</p>
            <p>In all honesty I didn't get to include all of the things I meant to put in this game, so to give myself some closure, I'll just make a list of all the things I planned to add! Maybe I'll come back to this project one day and add it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More types of enemies with special abilities and stronger stats</li>
                <li>Enemies get stronger as time goes on</li>
                <li>More types of commands and a heal command to replenish your shield</li>
                <li>Commands spontaneously randomize themselves (the attack command might be "ABC" one moment and "DBA" the next)</li>
            </ul>
